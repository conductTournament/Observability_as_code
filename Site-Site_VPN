A Site-to-Site VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a type of VPN connection that allows two or more networks to securely connect over the internet or another public network.
It is configured both side of either Router or Firewall.
Types of VPN: 
1. Site-Site VPN - Uses IPsec Framework or Protocol - Disabled in some Public Networks(Wifi) - .
2. Remote Access VPN - Uses TLS security protocol - HTTPS(443) - Mostly enabled on all over public networks(Wifi) - . 

Popular site-site VPn = IPsec
IPsec is a framework or set of rules while creating VPN's over network.

How IPsec Works

Initiation:
IPsec communication begins with the establishment of a secure channel, usually through IKE (Internet Key Exchange). 
This process involves the negotiation of security parameters and keys between the peers(Two Routers).

Establishment of SAs:
Security Associations are established for both inbound and outbound traffic. Each SA contains information on the encryption and authentication methods, keys, and other settings.

Data Encryption and Authentication:
For ESP (when used), the data is encrypted before being sent. For AH, data integrity and authentication are ensured. The encrypted data is then sent through the network.

Decryption and Verification:
On the receiving end, the IPsec protocol decrypts the data if ESP is used and verifies its integrity and authenticity if AH is used.
